# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Description

The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the  [Belly Button Diversity dataset](https://github.com/BlazeMedina/Belly_Button/blob/main/samples.json)  which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels.

The dashboard includes:

-   dropdown to examine data from each individual
-   bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)
-   bubble chart featuring all microbial species
-   gauge of the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each individual
- added navigational bar with functional buttons to get a summary of the project or to chose a chart and explanation to focus on
